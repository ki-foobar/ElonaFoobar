The header files under the directory, are based on Boost.Random and modified by
KI to make them compilable without other Boost dependencies. See also each
files for details.

`std::uniform_int_distribution` is implementation-defined, i.e., we cannot
guarantee that the result generated by the same seed is always the same on any
platform. Since it is inappropriate for game use, I copied the implementation
of `boost::random::uniform_int_distribution` and required other utilities. The
reason I "copied" it, instead of refering to as dependent library, is that an
algorithm used to implement Boost.Random will change in the future perhaps.
