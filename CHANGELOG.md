  - Also, the function does not append `.lua` now. You have to specify extensions explicitly.

  - Toggle Console: `F12`
  - Open Console: `Shift+F12`
  - Previously, `F12` is bound to "Enable Voldemort mode" (Voldemort mode is super wizard mode). In this version, there is no shortcut key for it, but you can run `voldemort` command in the console to enable the mode.
